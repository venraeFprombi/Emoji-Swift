## Drawbacks and Limitations
 
While the Zinertek HD Cockpit Environment package is a great add-on for the Level-D 767 fans, it also has some drawbacks and limitations that you should be aware of before buying it. Some of these are:

- The add-on does not include any changes or improvements to the exterior model or textures of the Level-D 767. You will need to use other add-ons or repaints for that.
- The add-on does not include any changes or improvements to the flight dynamics or systems of the Level-D 767. You will need to use other add-ons or patches for that.
- The add-on does not include any changes or improvements to the virtual cabin or passenger views of the Level-D 767. You will need to use other add-ons or mods for that.
- The add-on requires a lot of VRAM (video memory) to run smoothly. You might experience some performance issues or stutters if you have a low-end graphics card or a high-resolution monitor.
- The add-on is not compatible with other cockpit enhancement packages for the Level-D 767. You will need to uninstall or disable them before installing this add-on.

These drawbacks and limitations might not be a deal-breaker for some users, but they are important to consider if you are looking for a complete overhaul of the Level-D 767. The Zinertek HD Cockpit Environment package is mainly focused on improving the cockpit visuals and sounds, not the other aspects of the aircraft.
