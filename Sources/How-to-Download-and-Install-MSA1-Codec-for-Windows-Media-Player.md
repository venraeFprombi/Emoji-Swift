If you want to play MSA1 video files on your Windows Media Player, you may need to download and install a special codec that supports this format.

A codec is a software component that encodes or decodes digital data, such as audio or video. Windows Media Player can play many common media formats, but it may not support some less popular or proprietary ones. In that case, you need to install the appropriate codec to enable Windows Media Player to recognize and play the file.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install the MSA1 codec for Windows Media Player on Windows 10/11 N. This version of Windows does not include Windows Media Player and related technologies by default, so you need to install them separately. You also need to install some additional media codecs from Microsoft Store to play MSA1 files in apps and in the browser.
  
## Step 1: Install the Media Feature Pack for Windows 10/11 N
 
The Media Feature Pack for Windows 10/11 N provides support for media-related technologies, such as Windows Media Player, Groove Music, Movies & TV, Voice Recorder, and Skype. You must install this pack to have the communication functionality and to play or create audio CDs, media files, and video DVDs, to stream music, or to take and store pictures.
 
The Media Feature Pack for Windows 10/11 N is available for download as an Optional Feature. Hereâs how to install it:
 
- On Windows 10 N: Select Start, then select Settings > Apps > Apps and Features > Optional features > Add a feature. Find the Media Feature Pack in the list of available optional features[^1^].
- On Windows 11 N: Select Start, then select Settings > Apps > Optional features. Select View features next to Add an optional feature, and then select the Media Feature Pack in the list of available optional features[^2^].

Note: You will not be prompted to restart your computer, but you must restart in order to successfully complete installation of the Media Feature Pack.
  
## Step 2: Install the Media Codecs from Microsoft Store
 
After you have installed the Media Feature Pack, there are additional media codecs that you need to install from Microsoft Store to play MSA1 files in apps and in the browser. These include:
